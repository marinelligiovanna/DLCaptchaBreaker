Deep Learning Captcha Breaker
===================

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep artificial neural network that has been successfully applied to solve many image-processing problems. It can be used to identify faces, objects, animals, recognize traffic signs in self-driven cars and many other applications. Here we are going to use a CNN to solve one of the most basic tasks in machine learning: The character recognition. We will use it to break a simple numeric Captcha.
